# statistika

Statistika was created to generate the statistics of a handover of my company and that with one click. Normally I had to laboriously calculate every single day in Excel and write elaborate formulas.

This website is to read the statistics of my company and my handover with one click. It automatically reads and calculates the worksheets ( day 1 - 31 ). The cells that are read can be customized in the code. This website is only adapted to the handover of my current job. 

With a few clicks the .xls .excel is uploaded and processed. 

On the other pages you can see the statistics in a container with collapse function. In addition, the sum of the respective days is displayed and the statistics are shown with the help of a line chart.
